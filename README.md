# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Output:

1. Describe your project.

   - My project is an image of a cat. The cat is tan with green eyes and has a pink background. I painted a cat because they are my favorite animal and look really cute. I made a pink background because pink is my favorite color and I thought it would match with the cat well. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - One thing I am proud of about my project is how the cat looks. I think the cat came out super cute and how I pictured it. I am also proud because this is the first compsci project I did completely on my own. Last year, every project was in groups so this was the first project I did on my own.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - I think I would choose a different thing to paint because the cat was very tedious and hard to code. This is because I had to paint the cat line by line, changing the color every space.
